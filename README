== Framework Test

This pretty simple test attempts to measure the time it takes to load the framework and do some basic tasks. 
The first is to load the page with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/CR-css3-selectors-20011113/">W3C css selector</a> page 
pre-loaded into a hidden div.  It then dynamically loads in the <a href="http://sos.georgia.gov/elections/election_results/2008_1104/001.htm">Georgia 2008 Presidential election results</a>, again in a hidden div.  
Next it loads in the 
<a href="http://sos.georgia.gov/elections/election_results/2008_1104/003.htm">Georgia 2008 Senate</a> results and attaches a 
click event to all the <span style="color: red">red</span> elements.  Finally,
it loads in the <a href="http://sos.georgia.gov/elections/election_results/2008_1104/swall.htm">Georgia 2008 election summary.</a>
All files are served from the local server to avoid mistimes due to network latency.

Because of the way Appcelerator works, instead of using a selector to attach an event, I've created
a different version of the "dynamic" html file with "on" expressions set for the red elements.  I 
feel this test is more fair, since there's no reason to select through the dom when Appcelerator
processes each element by default.

This is a rails app, so you should just be able to download it, then run script/server.
Navigate to localhost:3000 and you'll be good to go.

Feel free to fork and improve as you see fit.
